## Synopsis

Smalliermouse is a variation of SmallyMouse2 by D Henderson specificially designed for the Atari ST & Falcon to fit within the keyboard mouse plug bay.

## Motivation

USB plugs for modern (and particularly wireless) devices are so small theses days that, buy reducing the SmallyMouse2 footprint to its bare minimum would allow the entire mouse emulator to fit within the below-keyboard recess of the Atari ST range of computers.

## Installation

Note: This is an Atmel Studio 7 project that can be loaded and compiled by the IDE
